Note for grading: 

When prompted if "Would you like to update the dining menu? (Y to update)" this is needed to add additional classifications as part of the webscraping setup, but grading purposes please select N. 

Depending on when grading occurs, some dining halls may be closed or have nothing on their menus. Since our program
updates using real time data, there will be days especially over the summer that filtering for menus for certain dining halls will produce an empty list. 

Another note about the updates of the menu list of foods, if the list isn't updated in a while then the foods might be
outdated and the menus won't show everything. 

For best viewing of the terminal, please use full screen terminal.

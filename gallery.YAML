  CamlNom is a one-stop shop for Cornell students to decide where to eat depending on their cravings of the day. 
  Users can select from a wide range of cuisines and dietary restrictions from each dining hall to see if it 
  meets their needs. This will help students to not only select dining options that suit their 
  interests and tastes the most, but also to aid students with dietary restrictions to make informed decisions about 
  what and where they can eat based on their dietary needs. 
  
  These features will be enhanced by a feedback system where students are able to submit commentary or rankings of their 
  experience. Students can also view others' feedback and filter by specific ratings. Students will also be able to share
  their own favorite meals by creating a "plate" and detailing that dishes they added. 
  Updates are made live whenever Cornell Dining refreshes their dining page and loads in real time data so that all the 
  information provided to users are up to date.
